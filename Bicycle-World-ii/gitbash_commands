Cd into the directory you want to create the new project. 

mkdir bicycle-world-ii // creates the folder 

touch brands.txt  // creates the txt file inside the bicycle-world-ii folder

mkdir freight  //creates new folder in bicycle-world-ii

mkdir mountain //creates new folder in bicycle-world-ii

mkdir racing  //creates new folder in bicycle-world-ii

cd freight   // takes you to the freight folder

mkdir messenger
mkdir porteur   //created two new folders in the freight folder

cd ../     //takes you back the main bicycle-world-ii folder

cd racing  //takes you to the racing folder

mkdir road
mkdir track  //creates two new folders in the racing folder

cd ../     //back to the bicycle-world-ii folder

cd mountain  //now inside the mountain folder

mkdir downhill   
mkdir hardtail   //creates two new folders within the mountain folder

cd downhill  //now inside the downhill folder

mkdir heavyweight
mkdir lightweight  //creates two new folders within the downhill folder

THIS CREATES THE FILESYSTEM TO START WITH. NEXT ARE THE COMMANDS CODEACADEMY USES:

pwd     //prints the current directory you are in
/home/ccuser/workspace/bicycle-world-ii  //example

ls    //lists the files/folders within the current directory you are in
brands.txt   freight  mountain  racing

cd freight   //takes you to freight directory
cd porteur  //takes you to the porteur directory

cd ../../     <--takes you back 2 directories to bicycle-world-ii folder

cd mountain/downhill   //this takes you 2 directories in

touch dirt.txt    //this creates a text file mud in the downhill folder
touch mud.txt     //this creates a text file dirt in downhill folder

ls      //lists the contents of the downhill directory
dirt.txt   heavyweight   lightweight   mud.txt

mkdir safety    //creates a new folder within the downhill folder
ls
dirt.txt   heqvyweight   lightweight  mud.txt  safety

cd ../../    <--back to main directory bicycle-world-ii

mkdir bmx    <--create this new directory for the bike shop in the bicycle-world-ii folder

touch bmx/tricks.txt   //creates a tricks text file in the bmx folder without switching 
                       // from the current directory bicycle-world-ii
                       
ls      //list all files and directories in current directory           

  bmx   brands.txt  freight   mountain   racing
  
THE NEW FILESYSTEM LOOKS LIKE THIS:

bicycle-world-ii
  brands.txt
  bmx 
      tricks.txt
  freight
      messenger
      porteur
  mountain
      downhill
          dirt.txt
          heavyweight
          lightweight
          mud.txt
          safety 
  racing
       road
       track
